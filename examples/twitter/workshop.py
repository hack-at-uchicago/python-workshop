import json

def tweets(filename, max_tweets = 0):
    """Generator function to iterate through a tweet dataset.

    This function is used like this:

       for tweet in tweets("tweets.json"):
           print tweet["text"]

    This would print the text of the all the tweets in file
    tweets.json.

    The function also accepts an optional max_tweets parameter
    to limit the number of tweets that will be read. For example,
    this would only print the first 50 tweets:

       for tweet in tweets("tweets.json", max_tweets=50):
           print tweet["text"]

    If instead of iterating through the dataset you want to
    get a list of tweets, use the get_tweets() function instead.

    Parameters:
     filename - Dataset filename
     max_tweets - Maximum number of tweets to load from the dataset.
                  Note that fewer tweets may be returned if n is
                  larger than the number of tweets in the dataset.
                  If this parameters is 0, all the tweets in the file
                  are loaded.

    Returns:
    Each iteration yields a single tweet, represented as a 
    dictionary containing the fields returned by the Twitter API (see 
    https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects/tweets)
