This file contains two Twitter datasets.

Each dataset is a text file, with one tweet
per line (encoded in JSON). Each tweet
contains the information returned by the
Twitter API (see https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects/tweets).
Note that the file itself is not a valid JSON 
file (it must be read line by line, and each 
line should be decoded separately).
